# Things that need doing

* Add API end point so that the client application can get the public keys for
  the specified users.
* Add API end point so that the client application can tell the service it is
  hosting a pairing session and that the service should notify the invited
  users.
* Add validation to the SSH public keys to make sure that people can't put
  invalid key values in and break the authorized_keys file.
* Make it so that when you signup it gives you the option to provide a key
  name and value to stream line the getting going process.
